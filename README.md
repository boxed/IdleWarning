IdleWarning
===========

A program for OS X that warns when the computer is close to starting 
the screensaver/going into energy saving mode. This somewhat emulates
the behavior of MacBooks on stationary macs. 


Why?
====

Because at work we have a lock policy and it's really annoying to be
interrupted with a locked screen and having to retype my password
just because the energy saving timeout passed while I was doing
something.
